2. Short guide to flowchart writing
-------------------------------------
It's very easy to write a flowchart for PHPflow once you've got an overview.
First of all, you should take a look at the preview.ini if you haven't already
done so. It is located in the data subdirectory of your PHPflow directory.
You can use it as a starting point for your first PHPflow flowchart.

Let's get serious now.
In the [general] section the main parameters are defined.
Most of them should be self-explanatory:

title                page-title
headline             page-headline
subheadline          for additional infos
element_width        witdh for all symbols
element_height       height for all symbols
arrow_space          width and height for all arrows
font_size            fontsize of the internal PHP font (1-5)

After you've set these, you can start writing the first symbol.
For every row you start, you'll need a row identifier first.
This is [row<id>] while <id> can be a number but doesn't need to.
In fact you can use what you want there, PHPflow will read it from up to 
down, using the id primarily for the internal anchor link target (url#<id>).

Next, you need to specify, which symbol you want to use. Scroll a bit up for
a complete symbol list. Usually you'll start with a terminator-symbol.
As it is the first symbol in the row, you need to write:
type1 = "Terminator"

If you take a look at your flowchart now, you'll see a Terminator with
nothing in it. For text to appear inside of it, you'll need to write text
and the number of the symbol in which you want to have it. In this case:
text1 = "Start"

After you have the symbol ready now, you'll want to connect it to the next
by an arrow. To accomplish this, simply put an
type2 = "ArrowRight"
under it, if you want the next symbol right of it, or use a new row and put
[row<nextid>]
type1 = "ArrowDown"
under it, if you want the next symbol under the first one.

Repeat these steps, until you've completely drawn your flowchart.

Some of the symbols can use more parameters than other. Here's an overview:

Arrow          text,link,start,end
Line           text,link,start,end
LineShort      text,link,start,end

All the others just support text and link besides 'none' which logically
doesn't support any parameter.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

II.  TROUBLESHOOTING
======================

First of all, don't panic. This is BETA-software, so this can happen.

Second, check if you meet the system requirements. (PHP/GD really working?)

Third, are there any errormessages displayed or in the logs which give
you a hint, where the problem might be ? If you are working on a secured
or production server, the display_errors directive might be turned off.
You can turn it on temporarily for this program by uncommenting the ini_set
command in common.php line 24 (but don't forget to change it back once
you solved the problem or your server admin may strangle you ... 
no, just kidding).

Fourth, if there's only a problem with one or some symbols, you may want to
turn the debugmode on in config.inc.php and have a look at the errorlog it
generates. The errorlog is by default in the logs subdirectory of your
PHPflow directory. If there's not enough debug output you can open the
appropriate file and call the log2file-function where you need it to send
the information you want to the errorlog. IMPORTANT: don't forget to chmod
the logs-directory (or whichever you set in config.inc.php) to 777 before
activating the debugmode.

And last but not least, if none of the above steps have helped, visit the
forum at http://phpflow.berlios.de or contact me at cyrix@users.berlios.de .
Please don't forget to provide accurate information about your web server,
its version, your PHP version and a detailed description of PHPflow's
misbehaviour.

III. THANKS
=============

Thanks to all those who have helped with hints, ideas, bug finding and code.
Special thanks to the following:

+++ DangerousCat and PeKa gave me essential hints about coding in PHP
    (especially after I've messed up the code with new features...) =)

+++ ole33 gave me the crucial hint about how to solve the drawDcs-issue.

+++ Without the help of icewind there would be no PHPflow-logo by now. 

I'm sorry if I should have forgotten someone, it's due to my bad capacity
of remembering. Please give me a yell then.
